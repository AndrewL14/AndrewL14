I'm Andrew a skilled backend web developer with expertise in Java, JavaScript, AWS, DynamoDB, Lambda, Git/Github, Dagger, and React. I have a strong foundation in creating scalable and efficient web applications with a focus on backend development.

I have experience building RESTful APIs, integrating with external APIs, managing and optimizing databases, and implementing serverless architectures. I'm well-versed in AWS services and have experience in deploying and managing applications on cloud platforms.
